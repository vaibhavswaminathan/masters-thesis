% By default, LaTeX uses the acronym name as its short form
\DeclareAcronym{LP}{short=LP,long=Logical Process,short-indefinite=an,long-plural=es}
% You should explicitly set the short form (e.g., if you want lowercase acronym names) to avoid a warning,
% in this case you MUST specify the short= keyword as the first one.
% Otherwise, the document doesen't currently compile under MacTeX (at least).
